The idea behind this independent config is to have a common source for secrets and configuration items. This way we allow people to access items regardless of where they are running a project and access is the same every time. The way in which configuration is handled now is very much based on the cloud platform and CI/CD system being used.

NOTE: Although environment variables are used extensively in the builds when run in CI/CD they are created from the other sources. When running locally these environment variables usually have to be created manually which runs the risk of exposure of sensitive data.

For example, at the moment, with all the work we have done with the https://github.com/ensono/independent-runner[Indpendent Runner], we can run pipelines locally and in ADO, GitHub Actions and any other CI/CD pipeline. However when things are run locally, environment variables have to be configured with relevant values for the runner to perform correctly.

To attempt to alleviate this I am proposing a similar strategy for secrets and configuration items whereby such data is held in a central location and can be accessed by authenticated person or system that needs it. In the case of a local runner, this would allow configuration of a a few simple environment variables, which allow the Independent Runner to access this central config.
