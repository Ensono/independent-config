== Things to look at Next

* Authentication needs to be enabled and added to the PowerShell scripts
** Authentication is built into Inifiscal API
** For Etcd, an API key needs to be generated and added to the config for Etcd when it starts up
* Need to be able to pull all values for environment back, across all projects
** Currently can only retrieve all items for a specific project and environment
* When adding values check the configuration store to ensure the named environment exists
** Entries to common do not need to have this check
* Decide on the infrastructure for the configuration store
** If using Kubernetes then obtain or build Helm charts
** If using PaaS components build up the Terraform to deploy the components
*** Azure Redis Cache
*** Azure Database for PostgreSQL
*** Azure Container Apps
* Add the scripts to the Independent Runner repo so that it is part of EIR
* Choose a a project with Terraform output that can be pushed to a configuration deployment
* Need to add TLS certificates to the endpoint
* Look into the supported backends and features for Infisical

Ideally the config should be separate to the main Stacks deployment, e.g. out of band so that is is not removed by accident. This is achievable by using PaaS components.
