=== Etcd

Etcd is a distributed key-value store that is designed to provide a reliable way to store data across a cluster of machines. It is a core component of Kubernetes and is used to store configuration data and secrets.

The API to communicate with Etcd is very simple and fast.

So that Etcd can be used to test the ideas in this repo, I have created a Docker Compose file which will start an instance of Etcd within Docker on the local machine.
