==== Setup

In order to get Etcd up and running locally, please following the instructions below.

NOTE: It is a good idea to run the Compose command from a different terminal window.

[source,powershell]
----
cd .\deploy\composer\etcd\

docker compose -f .\docker-compose.yml up
----

.Docker startup for Etcd
image::images/etcd-docker-compose.png[]

Now that Etcd is up and running, some data needs to be added to it to check that the data can be extracted in the different formats. The `src/data` directory contains data that can be loaded in.
