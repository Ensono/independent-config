==== Setup

It is a good idea to get start the containers from a separate terminal window. This will mean that the VSCode is not blocked by the containers and it is possible to run the examples in this repo.

[source,powershell]
----
cd .\deploy\composer\infisical\

docker compose -f .\docker-compose.yml up
----

.Docker startup for Infisical
image::images/infisical-docker-compose.png[]

The composer image starts up Infisical so it can be accessed from the local machine on port, e.g. http://localhost. The first time the site is accessed, a new admin user and password needs to be created.

.Create initial user in Infisical

NOTE: After creating the initial user, a page will be displayed that prompts the download of a PDF file. This file contains the emergency access if the admin user is lost.

Out of the box, Infisical requires authentication for API access. Using an API key is being deprecated in favour of Machine Identity. Please use the following link to create a Token for the API access.
